In this repository, I used a given items.js and index.html file to create a main.js file, which used different array method to render the answers to specific questions on to a page. This was our big Project for Week 2 in The Iron Yard Program. 

I used HTML, CSS, JS and a nodes_model packaged that included gulp-babel, gulp-notify, gulp-plumber and gulp-sass to help keep my code correctly scaffolded. 

Here is deployed project link: jefdonmar-week2.surge.sh

I hope you enjoy!
